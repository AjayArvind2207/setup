# Setup
This repository contains the setup files for different tools I use.

Lets get started by installing Ubuntu 20.04

[Linux Setup](Linux.md)

Now that we have installed Linux, we will install some useful softwares on the OS. But before that do update the already installed softwares by running,
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

[Software installation](Softwares.md)
